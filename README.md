### Chirrup: A Full-Stack Social Media Application
## Project Overview
Chirrup is a full-stack social media application developed as a part of the Full Stack Web Development unit at Manchester Metropolitan University. This project demonstrates a full-featured application designed to scale, incorporating best practices and modern development techniques.

## Features
**Backend Server:** Built with Node.js and Express.js, implementing RESTful API endpoints as specified in the provided Swagger documentation.
**Frontend Client:** Developed using Vue.js to create a responsive and interactive user experience.
**Extension Tasks:** Additional features like profanity filters and local draft storage.

## Development
The project structure is divided into two main directories: backend-server and frontend-app, encapsulating the server-side and client-side code, respectively.

## Backend Server

At the heart of Chirrup's server-side, the Node.js and Express.js stack offers robustness and efficiency. The backend server features:
- **Controllers:** Manage the request-response cycle for user accounts, posts, and social interactions, ensuring RESTful API standards.
- **Models:** Define data structures for users, posts, and other entities, interfacing seamlessly with a SQLite database for persistence.
- **Routes:** Facilitate clear and organised endpoint definitions for each feature area, including feeds, posts, and user management.
- **Authentication:** Implements security measures for user sessions and data protection, leveraging middleware for route authentication.

Chirrup's frontend is crafted using Vue.js, providing a reactive and engaging user experience. Key aspects include:
- **Components:** Reusable UI components like CreatePost and LikePost enhance user interactivity and reduce code redundancy.
- **Views:** Dedicated views for each page, including Home, Profile, and Login, structured for a seamless user journey.
- **Routing:** Vue Router manages navigation within the app, ensuring users can access and discover features intuitively.
- **State Management:** Pinia stores manage global states for likes maintaining consistency and reactiveness across the app.
